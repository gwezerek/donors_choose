TEACHER REQUESTS
Delaware teachers really careas about Applied Learning and Health+Sports
Arkansas teachers is big into Applied Learning and History+Civics at the expense of Literacy+Language

DONOR FULFILLMENT
Michigan, which sees 89 percent of its requests fulfilled, is the most-funded state by a magnitude of almost 10 points.
Almost every one of Michigan's 3510 requests for music and arts materials was fulfilled (99.7%).
Almost every one of Michigan's 9339 requests for math and science materials was fulfilled (99.5%).
Indiana is the least-funded state, with only 55 percent of all requests fulfilled.

Some states have large disparities across resource type fulfillment:
In Alaska, 88 percent of requests are fulfilled in Applied Learning, but only 38 percent of requests for special aid materials receive funding.
Vermont has a similar disparity, where 80 percent of Math and Science is a yes, but 31 percent of special needs gets the greenlight.
Iowas requests for history materials were 93 percent approved, but mathsci and litlang were at 63% and 64%, respectively.
Almost all history and civics requests (99.5%) were fulflilled in Maine, but only 58% of Health and Sports got the greenlight.
New Hampshire history and civics weren't as important (54% yes), but 85% got lit and lang.
Idaho was 32 percent likely to fund health and sports, but the average request was 74 precent likely to get a yes.
WY and AK were big into "Applied Learning," with 87 and 88% of requests gettingyes vs a 65 and 74% avg., respectively.
Nebraska, on the other hand, wasn't having it, with only 55% of applied learning geting yes vs. a 72% avg yes rate.

Discrepancies between what teachers ask for and what donors want to fund:
Parents aren't second-guessing their teachers' expertise. In 99 percent of cases, donors were within three percentage points of requests in terms of which subjects they funded.
Sixty-two percent of teacher requests in Wyoming were for Literacy and Language, but only 53 percent of completed projects fell into that category.


Questions
What sort of request gets categorized as Applied Learning?
How do these results compare to NAEP scores?


Complicating factors:
Grade
Poverty Level
Urban vs. rural

I could divide the amount of money by the number of projects, which would give me the avg. amount proposed per project vs avg amount spent.
COnfusing metric because projects are either funded or they aren't.


PROJECTS
Based in New York, Donors Choose has taken off in the state, perhaps due to press coverage and a concentration of high-poverty schools. From 2008 to 2013, teachers in the state proposed 54,900 projects for every 100,000 students in the New York public school system. Compare that with neighboring Vermont, which had the lowest rate, 39 projects per 100,000 students.

New York has the fifth highest funding success rate, at 76 percent. States in the American South make up four of the five least funded states, despite high project request rates. South Carolina has the lowest funding success rate, at 56 percent, compared to the national avearge of 69 percent funding success.

Proposing a project in Arkansas can be frustrating or exhilirating, depending on what class your happen to teach. Math and science requests receive full funding 83 percent of the time, America's highest success rate in that category. Arkansas might be likely to joing other Southern states, which make up four out of the five least-funded overall in the nation. But the Walton Family Foundation, run by the owners of Walmart, have partnered with organizations to fund hundreds of thosands of dollars in proposals across the state. Teachers eagerly took advantage of the incentive--Arkansas is the only state where math and science outnumbered literacy and languag requests. But at 48 percent, the state's special needs success rate is the second-lowest in the nation, and the health and sports success rate of 51 percent is America's lowest.  

Donors generally trust teachers when it comes to what kind of resources students needs. There seems to be a slight reluctance when it comes to funding Applied Learning requests, a category that includes early childhood development, college preparatory materials and technology such as iPads and computers. Despite being the fourth most requested category, donors were least likely to fund Applied Learning materials. Among states, Nebraska was least likely to fund Applied Learning projects (47%) while Alaska was the highest (77%). Overall, Music and Arts requests were most likely to be funded.

Teachers and donors aren't totally in lockstep when it comes to what kind of resources students need. Applied learning materials are the fourth most common request, but they're the least
